# Override the GenericWork model

The GenericWork class is generated by default in Sufia, but we want to update the model with our own metadata so we define it in our app to override what Sufia provides. Since Rails finds the class in our local application, it won't load it from Sufia.

```ruby
# app/models/generic_work.rb
class GenericWork < ActiveFedora::Base
  include ::CurationConcerns::WorkBehavior
  include ::CurationConcerns::BasicMetadata
  include Sufia::WorkBehavior
  self.human_readable_type = 'Work'
end
```

## Add the property

We'll add a select box of university departments, and make it a non-repeatable field. Add the property declaration into the `GenericWork` class (and pass a block to make sure the property is indexed in Solr):

```ruby
  property :department, predicate: ::RDF::URI.new("http://lib.my.edu/departments"), multiple: false do |index|
    index.as :stored_searchable, :facetable
  end
```

If you'd like the field to be repeatable your block should look like this:

```ruby
  property :department, predicate: ::RDF::URI.new("http://lib.my.edu/departments") do |index|
    index.as :stored_searchable, :facetable
  end
```

When you're done the file should look like this:

```ruby
class GenericWork < ActiveFedora::Base
  include ::CurationConcerns::WorkBehavior
  include ::CurationConcerns::BasicMetadata
  include Sufia::WorkBehavior
  self.human_readable_type = 'Work'

  property :department, predicate: ::RDF::URI.new("http://lib.my.edu/departments"), multiple: false do |index|
    index.as :stored_searchable, :facetable
  end
end
```

# Create a vocabulary

```ruby
## config/authorities/departments.yml
terms:
  - id: English
    term: English
  - id: History
    term: History
  - id: Latin
    term: Latin
  - id: Zoology
    term: Zoology
```

# Create a service to load the vocabulary

```ruby
# services/departments_service.rb
module DepartmentsService
  mattr_accessor :authority
  self.authority = Qa::Authorities::Local.subauthority_for('departments')

  def self.select_all_options
    authority.all.map do |element|
      [element[:label], element[:id]]
    end
  end

  def self.label(id)
    authority.find(id).fetch('term')
  end
end
```

# Create a view to display your field

```erb
# records/edit_fields/_department.html.erb
<%= f.input :department, as: :select,
    collection: DepartmentsService.select_all_options,
    include_blank: true,
    item_helper: method(:include_current_value),
    input_html: { class: 'form-control' }
%>
```

# Update the form so that your new field will display

```ruby
# forms/curation_concerns/generic_work_form.rb
module CurationConcerns
  class GenericWorkForm < Sufia::Forms::WorkForm
    self.model_class = ::GenericWork
    self.terms += [:department]
  end
end
```

## If you would like to make your new field required

```ruby
# forms/curation_concerns/generic_work_form.rb
module CurationConcerns
  class GenericWorkForm < Sufia::Forms::WorkForm
    self.model_class = ::GenericWork
    self.terms += [:department]
    # Add following line if you'd like to make your field required
    self.required_fields += [:department]
  end
end
```

# Making a default Sufia field non-repeatable

By default all fields in Sufia are repeatable. If you'd like to change this behavior for a field that Sufia provides out of the box, the title field in this case, you can do the following:

```ruby
# forms/curation_concerns/generic_work_form.rb
module CurationConcerns
  class GenericWorkForm < Sufia::Forms::WorkForm
    self.model_class = ::GenericWork
		
    def self.multiple?(field)
      if field.to_sym == :title
        false
      else
        super
      end
    end
		
    # cast title back to multivalued so it will actually deposit
    def self.model_attributes(_)
      attrs = super
      attrs[:title] = Array(attrs[:title]) if attrs[:title]
      attrs
    end
  end
end
```

# Make the field searchable
Inside app/controllers/catalog_controller.rb, add the following:
```ruby
config.add_show_field solr_name("department", :stored_searchable), label: "Department"
```

# Adjustments to display the field in work display
Add the field to app/models/solr_document.rb
```ruby
def department
  self[Solrizer.solr_name('department')]
end
```

Add the field to app/presenters/sufia/work_show_presenter.rb
```ruby
delegate :department, to: :solr_document
```

Add the field to app/views/curation_concerns/base/_metadata.html.erb
```ruby
<%= presenter.attribute_to_html(:department) %>
```
