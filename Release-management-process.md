1. Does the release require QA, usability testing, or an accessibility audit? Schedule that to happen before cutting the final release if needed. Lean on the community to help with QA; on the UXIG to help with usability testing; and on [Colin Fulton](https://github.com/justcolin) to help with targeted accessibility audits. Ping [Mike Giarlo](https://github.com/mjgiarlo) (serving as product owner for Sufia) for assistance with coordination.
1. Bump the version number in [version.rb](https://github.com/projecthydra/sufia/blob/master/lib/sufia/version.rb) to a [SemVer](http://semver.org/)-appropriate version; feel free to consult others (via Slack, hydra-tech, or a Hydra Tech call) if you're not sure.
1. Modify [the README](https://github.com/projecthydra/sufia/blob/master/README.md) **and** [the install template](https://github.com/projecthydra/sufia/blob/master/template.rb) to replace all instances of the past version with the new version.
1. Add, commit, and push your README and version changes directly to the master branch of the **[upstream](https://github.com/projecthydra/sufia)** repository.
1. Release the gem to rubygems.org:
  * If this is your first time pushing to rubygems.org for a Hydra project
    * Create an account at rubygems.org if you haven't already, or make note of your rubygems.org email address.
    * Ask on Slack or hydra-tech about making you an owner of the gem on rubygems.org. (Your rubygems.org email address and GitHub username need to be added to [this script](https://github.com/projecthydra/hydra/blob/master/script/grant_revoke_gem_authority.rb#L19), and then someone who already has owner access needs to run that script.)
    * Ask on Slack or hydra-tech about adding you to the Owners team in the projecthydra GitHub organization.
    * If you have not yet, set up `~/.gem/credentials` according to [these instructions](https://rubygems.org/profile/edit).
  *  Run the `rake release` task.
1. Create [release notes in GitHub](https://github.com/projecthydra/sufia/releases/new). In the new release, include at least a block with upgrade notes and a block showing the changelog -- see script [changelog.sh](https://github.com/projecthydra/hydra/blob/master/script/changelog.sh) for help generating changelog entries. (See [an example](https://github.com/projecthydra/sufia/releases/tag/v6.4.0).)
1. Update the [Hydra Stack Built-in Feature Checklist](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/Built-in+Feature+Checklist) to indicate features that have been added, removed, or moved to a different layer of the stack.
1. Send a release message to [hydra-tech](mailto:hydra-tech@googlegroups.com), [hydra-community](mailto:hydra-community@googlegroups.com), and [hydra-releases](mailto:hydra-releases@googlegroups.com) describing the changes (which you can copy from the GitHub release). (*This assumes you've already joined those three lists.* Do that first!) It may be helpful to base your message on [a prior example](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/hydra-releases/SvQAhtIgpqA), which also contains some new text explicitly thanking contributors, which you can get from the changelog.
