1. Modify [the README](https://github.com/projecthydra/sufia/blob/master/README.md) to replace all instances of the past version with the new version. *Please double-check your changes* to make sure you don't have typos, since you'll be pushing this work directly to the master branch without any community review.
1. Add, commit, and push to the [upstream](https://github.com/projecthydra/sufia) repository.
1. Bump the version number in [SUFIA_VERSION](https://github.com/projecthydra/sufia/blob/master/SUFIA_VERSION) to a [SemVer](http://semver.org/)-appropriate version; feel free to consult others (via IRC, hydra-tech, or a Hydra Tech call) if you're not sure. **Do not add, commit, or push this change.** (If you look at previous release commits you'll see changes also to `lib/sufia/version.rb`, and `sufia-models/lib/sufia/models/version.rb` -- resist the temptation to directly modify those, as the rake task called in a later step will take care of them for you.)
1. Modify [the changelog](https://github.com/projecthydra/sufia/blob/master/History.md) to include changes in the version (which can be pulled from commit messages -- `see previous entries in History.md for examples`). **Do not add, commit, or push this change.**
1. Release the gem to rubygems.org:
  * If this is your first time pushing to rubygems.org for a Hydra project
    * Create an account at rubygems.org if you haven't already, or make note of your rubygems.org email address.
    * Ask on IRC or hydra-tech about making you an owner of the gem on rubygems.org. (Your rubygems.org email address and GitHub username need to be added to [this script](https://github.com/projecthydra/hydra/blob/master/script/grant_revoke_gem_authority.rb#L19), and then someone who already has owner access needs to run that script.)
    * Ask on IRC or hydra-tech about adding you to the Owners team in the projecthydra GitHub organization.
    * If you have not yet, set up `~/.gem/credentials` according to [these instructions](https://rubygems.org/profile/edit).
  *  Run the `rake all:release` task.
1. Create [release notes in GitHub](https://github.com/projecthydra/sufia/releases/new). In the new release, include at least a block with upgrade notes and a block showing the changelog (copy from earlier step). (See [an example](https://github.com/projecthydra/sufia/releases/tag/v6.4.0).)
1. Send a release message to [hydra-tech](mailto:hydra-tech@googlegroups.com), [hydra-community](mailto:hydra-community@googlegroups.com), and [hydra-releases](mailto:hydra-releases@googlegroups.com) describing the changes (which you can copy from the GitHub release). (*This assumes you've already joined those three lists.* Do that first!) It may be helpful to base your message on [a prior example](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/hydra-releases/SvQAhtIgpqA), which also contains some new text explicitly thanking contributors, which you can get from the changelog.
