* [List of tickets](https://github.com/projecthydra/sufia/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22May+Hydra+PCDM%22) to be worked on during the Sprint in May. You can also look at them via the [Waffle board](https://waffle.io/projecthydra/sufia?milestone=May%20Hydra%20PCDM).

* *Warning, here be dragons*. The following two documents were created during LDCX in the last week of March. These are very rough notes that people captured during the sessions but they provide some context if you are curious of how the whole thing came together: [PCDM Mappings - Reference Diagrams for Comment](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FF/PCDM+Mappings+-+Reference+Diagrams+for+Comment) and [Sufia move to PCDM](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-TOtzXs87U0yOWjt34xO0dwsvIcRvIniZww5LQEwA6o/edit)

* Notes from [[PCDM Planning Meeting 1]]

* The [Sufia Sprint Home page](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/Sufia+Sprint+-+2015-05-04+thru+05-15) at Duraspace.

* [Architecture diagram](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WvPG7RCRW-o1W_WEMGdi_jE2ZJyewbZxqwPg0aazeJw/edit#slide=id.gaf6fb9983_0_0) of the gems to be created 

* [Service Objects](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/Service+Object+Approach#ServiceObjectApproach-Discussion) shows how to encapsulate business logic for `PCDM::Collection`, `Objects`, and `Files` and be able to re-use this logic in other applications.
