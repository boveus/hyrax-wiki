This is a work in progress and mostly documenting my thoughts on how we could import Sufia 6 Generic Files into Sufia 7 Generic Works -- Hector

TL;DR. Two steps, from a Sufia 6 application export to a JSON file the metadata of all the Generic Files. From a Sufia 7 application read the JSON file and create GenericWorks/FileSet/Files. The content of the GenericFiles is read straight from the Fedora instance used by the Sufia 6 application (i.e. the content is not in the JSON file.)
